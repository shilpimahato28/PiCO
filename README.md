🌸 Pico — Empowering Women’s Health with Technology

Millions of women, especially in rural and underserved areas, face challenges related to reproductive health due to limited awareness, social stigma, and lack of access to reliable healthcare. Conditions like PCOD/PCOS often go undetected, leading to long-term health complications, emotional stress, and reduced quality of life.

Pico was created to change that.

We believe that every young woman deserves access to knowledge, support, and timely healthcare—regardless of where she lives. Pico empowers women by:

Raising Awareness: Educating young women about PCOD/PCOS and reproductive health, helping them understand their bodies better.

Early Detection: Enabling self-assessment so that health issues are noticed early, before complications arise.

Safe & Supportive Community: Providing a private, women-only space to share experiences, stories, and advice.

Encouraging Healthy Habits: Helping users track cycles, fitness, and lifestyle habits to improve overall well-being.

With Pico, the goal isn’t just technology—it’s social impact. We aim to reduce health disparities, break taboos around women’s health, and create a platform where young women feel informed, supported, and empowered.
